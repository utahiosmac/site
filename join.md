# Join the Slack Group

The Utah iOS and Mac Developers Slack group is intended only for Cocoa developers residing in Utah. If you do not reside in Utah and are not an iOS/Mac developer, we encourage you to find a more appropriate group for your locale and interests. In general, this Slack group is not a place to recruit developers to come work for you.

If you meet these criteria, please send an email to `admin` at `utahdevelopers` dot `org` and provide the following information:

- Your full name
- Your email address
- The city in Utah where you live
- Your employer
- Who you might know that's already in the group
- Any iOS/macOS apps you work on
