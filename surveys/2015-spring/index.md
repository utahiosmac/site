A slack group has assembled recently in the Utah area around iOS and Mac development. It's become a nice little group. But I'm curious how it differs from the developer community from 2009, when I first started getting into iOS development. So I put together two quick polls. One specifically covered salaries and benefits. The other poll covered everything else. I'll cover the bigger one first.

**What type of Developer are you? (52 responses)**

<table class="survey-response">
	<tr>
		<td>iOS</td>
		<td>52</td>
		<td>100%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mac</td>
		<td>10</td>
		<td>19.2%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Android</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>7.7%</td>
	</tr>
</table>

**What type of iOS apps do you develop? (52 responses)**

        <td>Never!</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0.0%</td>

I asked what people were using to develop apps. e.g. Xcode, App Code, Xamarin.

4% were using App Code. Everyone else used Xcode.

**How do the apps you have developed recently make money? (52 responses)**

<table class="survey-response">

	</tr>
</table>

**What is your (or your employer's) hourly rate for contract app development? (37 responses)**

![Contract Rate](contract-rate.png)

The average rate was $104. If I remove some of the outliers, the average is $112.

**Salaries and benefits poll (35 responses):**

This poll ran separately from the above.

![Salaries and Benefits](salaries-and-benefits.png)

The average over the whole dataset was $105,000. I tried to exclude some of the outliers ($85k to $130k) and the average was $112,000. But that is a pretty strong signal at $120k.

**Benefits:**
